**Team 8 | AI For All Challenge 2026**

---

## Opening (30 seconds)

> **Speaker:** "Good [morning/afternoon], judges! We're Team 8, and we're here to show you how AI can transform wholesale B2B commerce. Meet UnidBox - your AI Sales Agent for smarter wholesale ordering."

**[SHOW: Landing Page]**

> "Traditional wholesale ordering is broken. Dealers spend hours on phone calls, emails, and manual order forms. Sales reps are overwhelmed with repetitive inquiries. What if we could automate 80% of this with AI?"

---

## Part 1: Problem Understanding (1 minute) — 20% Weight

**[SHOW: Admin Dashboard with at-risk dealers]**

> "Let me show you the real problem. Here's our admin dashboard. See these dealers flagged as 'at-risk'? They haven't ordered in over 7 days. In wholesale, that's revenue walking out the door."

**Key Pain Points to Mention:**
1. **Manual Order Processing** - "Sales reps spend 4+ hours daily answering the same questions: 'What's the price?' 'Is it in stock?' 'Can I get a quote?'"

2. **Lost Revenue from Inactive Dealers** - "Without proactive engagement, dealers drift to competitors. Our system flags at-risk dealers automatically."

3. **Document Chaos** - "Quotations, Purchase Orders, Delivery Orders, Invoices - all disconnected. We've unified them into one flow."

> "We didn't just build a chatbot. We built a complete AI-powered sales ecosystem that understands the wholesale business."

## Part 2: Solution Effectiveness (1.5 minutes) — 30% Weight

### Demo Flow A: AI Conversational Ordering

**[NAVIGATE: Dealer Portal → AI Sales Agent Chat]**

> "Let me show you the magic. I'm logged in as a dealer. Watch this..."

**Type in chat:** "I need to restock CAT6 cables"

> "The AI instantly recognizes my intent, shows me products with MY tier-specific pricing, and offers to add items to cart - all in natural conversation."

**Type:** "Add 10 CAT6 cables to my cart"

> "Done! No forms, no phone calls. The AI understood my request and executed it."

**Type:** "Place my order"

> "Watch this - the system creates the order, generates a Delivery Order number, and confirms everything. What used to take 15 minutes now takes 60 seconds."

### Demo Flow B: Full Document Lifecycle

**[NAVIGATE: Admin Console → Quotations]**

> "On the admin side, we have the complete document flow. Quotation → Purchase Order → Delivery Order → Invoice. Each document links to the next."

**[Click: Create Quotation → Show form]**

> "Admins can create quotations, dealers receive notifications, accept to create POs, and the system tracks everything."

## Part 3: Innovation & Creativity (1 minute) — 15% Weight

**[NAVIGATE: Admin → Dealers → Click "View Details" on an at-risk dealer]**

> "Here's where we get creative. See this dealer hasn't ordered in 12 days? Watch what happens when I click 'Send AI Reminder'..."

**[Click: Send AI Reminder]**

> "The AI generates a personalized re-engagement message based on their purchase history. It's not a generic template - it's intelligent outreach."

**[NAVIGATE: Dealer Portal → Notification Bell]**

> "And the dealer receives it in real-time. This proactive AI engagement is what sets us apart."

**Innovation Highlights:**
- "AI doesn't just respond - it proactively identifies business opportunities"
- "Natural language ordering eliminates the learning curve"
- "Unified document flow replaces 4 separate systems"
